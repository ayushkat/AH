<h5>Hey World! My name is Ayushka Tiwary and I am a human just like everyone of you reading this and I live on this great planet called Earth. However, I feel that Earth has evolved so much so quickly that people have had a hard time constantly adjusting to its growth. So much so that every new generation carries even more stress than the previous. We have so much of pressure to better than the previous generation that it gets hard to keep up with life. But all of this still can't change the fact that we all are still just talking monkeys flying through the universe on an organic sapceship. So it if you ever start taking life too seriously just remember that. <small>(Joe Rogan kinda said that so I can't take full credit)</small> </h5>
