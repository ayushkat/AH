<p>Hi! My name is Ayushka as you can tell by the title and I am creating my very own website for the first time by scratch so I wanted to show you all how i did it.</p>

<p><i>I learned to format my text in different ways.</i> <b>For example, I can do this to give my text significance</b> or I can <small>make text smaller</small> to make sure you don't read it. <small> That's how companies manage to get signatures on contracts.</small> In some cases I can even <mark>lead your eyes</mark> wherever I'd like to. I can probably also use two formats at the same time <b><mark> like this</mark></b> or <ins><del> like this,</del></ins> actually scratch that. What I really  meant to show you <i><sub>was this.</sub></i> So as you can see, there are a lot of ways to format your text in Html.</p>
